# VeriSol

VeriSol (Verifier for Solidity) is a [Microsoft Research project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/verisol-a-formal-verifier-for-solidity-based-smart-contracts/) for prototyping a formal verification and analysis system for smart contracts developed in the popular [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) programming language. It is based on translating
programs in Solidity language to programs in [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) intermediate 
verification language, and then leveraging and extending the verification toolchain for Boogie programs. The following [blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/researchers-work-to-secure-azure-blockchain-smart-contracts-with-formal-verification/) provides a high-level overview of the initial goals or VeriSol.

The following paper describes the design of VeriSol and application of smart contract verification for [Azure Blockchain](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/):

## INSTALL

Instructions for installing and running VeriSol can be found [here](INSTALL.md).

## VeriSol Code Contracts library

The code contract library **VeriSolContracts.sol** is present [here](/Test/regressions/Libraries/VeriSolContracts.sol). This allows adding specifications in the form of pre/post conditions, loop invariants, contract invariants, modifies clauses, and extending the assertion language with constructs such as old, sum, etc.
